Hi! Welcome to NBA Fantasy Edge. The purpose of this website is to predict which players are going to perform the best on a day-to-day basis. The raw score you see next to each players' name is based on a predictive model I've created that is based on the players' previous per-game statistics and advanced analytics. The players you see are of those who are on teams playing on opening night (October 16, 2018).

This website features many different languages. The data that I pulled all the stats from is based off of <a href="www.basketball-reference.com">www.basketball-reference.com's</a> page and is stored in a mysql database. To access those stats I used an express server in node.js. The design of the page was done using handlebars. All of this is done using the MVC framework of organizing code.
